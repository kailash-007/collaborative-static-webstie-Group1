    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to our sample website! This project is part of our DevOps course group task.
      We are a team of four members working together to create, collaborate, and deploy
      a simple website using GitHub.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>
      Our goal is to learn real-world collaboration with Git, GitHub branches,
      pull requests, and deployments.
